# 👋 Hi there, I'm Craig

I'm a backend-focused software engineer passionate about building scalable systems that automate and optimize real-world processes.

Currently, I'm working on:

- 🔄 **Offer processing pipelines** for platforms like Takealot — scalable Django + Celery systems that handle price tracking, updates, and API-based automation
- 🧠 **AI agents for call centers** — using OpenAI, LangChain, and FastAPI to assist human agents with transcription, summarization, sentiment analysis, and more

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python · JavaScript (basic)  
- **Frameworks**: Django · FastAPI · Celery  
- **Tools**: Redis · PostgreSQL · Docker · Git  
- **Cloud & Infra**: Azure · AWS · Railway · WSL · GitHub Actions  
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI APIs · LangChain · PGVector  
- **Exploring**: Kubernetes · Streaming pipelines · LLM-based agents

## 📦 Featured Projects

### 🛍️ Takealot Seller Management System  
Building a distributed offer processing system for Takealot sellers using public and private APIs.  
- Uses Django, Celery, and Redis to manage fetching, processing, and updating offers  
- Entity-based concurrency with horizontal scaling  
- Built for high-throughput, near real-time updates

### 🤖 AI Assistant for Customer Ops (RAG + WhatsApp + WooCommerce)  
Developing an AI agent to support call center workflows and customer interactions over WhatsApp and web.  
- Uses OpenAI + LangChain + PGVector for RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)  
- FastAPI backend integrated with WhatsApp, WooCommerce, and custom business logic  
- Supports summarization, sentiment, transcription, and context-aware responses

> My goal is to automate backend processes with AI and build a robust, scaled infrastructure.
