# 👋 Hi there, I'm Craig

I'm a backend-focused software engineer passionate about building scalable systems that automate and optimize real-world processes.

Currently, I'm working on:

- 🔄 **Offer processing pipelines** for platforms like Takealot — scalable Django + Celery systems that handle price tracking, updates, and API-based automation
- 🧠 **AI agents for call centers** — using OpenAI, LangChain, and FastAPI to assist human agents with transcription, summarization, sentiment analysis, and more

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python · JavaScript (basic)  
- **Frameworks**: Django · FastAPI · Celery  
- **Tools**: Redis · PostgreSQL · Docker · Git  
- **Cloud & Infra**: Azure · AWS · Railway · WSL · GitHub Actions  
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI APIs · LangChain · PGVector  
- **Exploring**: Kubernetes · Streaming pipelines · LLM-based agents

## 🚀 Featured Project

### [🤖 fastapi-project](https://github.com/Craigels07/fastapi-project)  
> Building the backend for an AI-powered assistant that integrates WhatsApp, WooCommerce, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

🔧 **Tech Stack**: FastAPI · LangChain · OpenAI · PGVector · PostgreSQL  
💡 **Use Case**: Helps automate customer service and call center tasks like transcription, summarization, and sentiment analysis  
📦 **Highlights**:
- Modular FastAPI endpoints
- Embedding storage and retrieval using PGVector
- Integrated with real-world platforms (WhatsApp, WooCommerce)
- RAG pipeline powered by LangChain + OpenAI

### 🛍️ Takealot Seller Management System  
Building a distributed offer processing system for Takealot sellers using public and private APIs.  
- Uses Django, Celery, and Redis to manage fetching, processing, and updating offers  
- Entity-based concurrency with horizontal scaling  
- Built for high-throughput, near real-time updates

> My goal is to automate backend processes with AI and build a robust, scaled infrastructure.
